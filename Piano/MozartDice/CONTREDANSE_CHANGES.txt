THis version of DiceWaltz has been altered by Robin Newman
to add the facility to play the Contredanses as well as the Minuets
which are part of the Phillips Edition of KV 516f 422 500-0

To do this, a separate dicelily.py script has been written, similar to
the original, but holding an array with the bar info for the 176
2/4 bars of the Contredanses. Modifications have been made to the
rest of this script to accommodate the chaged structure e.g. time signature
headings, version number.
This script is called dicelilycontredanse.py and the original dicelily.py
script has been renamed as dicelilywaltz.py but is otherwise unchanged.

The script for common.py has been altered with the addition of a second
array holding the table of bar choices for the contredanses.
This is called zahlentafeld, and the orginal table is renamed zahlentafelw
The procedure waltz is copied, the copy being named contredanse. The first, waltz,
is adjusted to use the zahlentafelw table and contredanse to use zahlentafeld
A second version string CONTREDANSE_VERSION is added to the top of the script

the original common.py is retained for reference, but not used and renamed
OLDcommon.py

The original dicewaltz.py is retained for reference, but not used, and renamed
OLDdicewaltz.py
A modified waltz.py replaces it. THis has the following changes
A line is added to give a new input arg -c to enable the user to select
the original waltz (1) or a contredanse (2) for the output
If the export mode is lily, then this argument is used to switch between
importing lilydicewalz or lilydicecontredanse, and the appropriate
out procedureis selected.
Logic is also added to quit the program if choice 2 is used with the
other output modes mup or abc for which I have not implemented it.

I hope you find the changes entertaining
